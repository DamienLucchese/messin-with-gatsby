    <p>
      I'm definitely the lucky one. My wonderful wife is incredible. I can not
      possibly say enough positive things about&nbsp;her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She always puts her family before herself, and is always the one to try to
      make everything special for everyone else. I'm absolutely blessed to have
      found such a good life partner, at such a young age. We have done a lot of
      growing up together and remain an inseparable&nbsp;team.
