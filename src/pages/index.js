    <p>
      Gatsby seems super&nbsp;neat. You can use react while you're developing

      I'm checking it out within codesandbox.io, 'cause why&nbsp;not? I'm
      currently inbetween jobs and while I am looking for that right next place
      for employment, I am also tinkering with tools I haven't used
      much&nbsp;before.
