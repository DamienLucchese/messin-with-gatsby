      For me it's about the recreational relationship between the bow and
      myself. Instinctive shooting is a challenge that I enjoy. No scope, no
      sights, no stabilizers, no tension aid, no release trigger. Just wood,
      string, arrow, hands and focus. Like throwing a ball, you look at where
      you want the arrow to go, pull back and release. Form is important but it
      seems the more you think, the worse you shoot...HA! I guess that's why
      they call it instinctive&nbsp;shooting.

      Currently, I shoot a PSE Nighthawk. It's a good takedown recurve bow for
      target use, with #35 at normal draw. My draw length goes beyond normal
      draw, at which the tension stacks beyond&nbsp;#35.

    <p>
      Nothing against others who hunt but I do not bow hunt. Don't get me wrong
      I like eating meat but I can't see myself releasing on an animal unless I
      absolutely needed to, to&nbsp;survive.
