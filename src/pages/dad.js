    <p>It's true, my kid is cooler than me. Like, by a&nbsp;lot.</p>
    <p>
      Since the day she was born, my daughter has amazed me every day. She is so
      sharp and I couldn't be&nbsp;prouder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching her building with Lego, drawing pictures, exercising her
      imagination by coming up with stories and songs, I wonder about what great
      things she will achieve when she's&nbsp;older.
